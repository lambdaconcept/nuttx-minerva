config IEEE802154_XBEE_FREQUENCY
	int "SPI Frequency for XBee Radio"
	default 2000000
	---help---
		SPI SLCK frequency in Hz

config XBEE_NETDEV_RECVRPRIO
	int "Priority of frame receiver registerd with the MAC layer"
	default 1
	---help---
		When the MAC layer receives an incoming data frame, it passes the frame
		to registered receivers, in order of receiver priority, until one of the
		receivers claim the frame.

		An example case would be when 6LoWPAN and the MAC character driver are
		enabled. Both have receivers registered with the MAC. The 6LoWPAN layer
		should get assigned a higher priority than the character driver. In this
		case, the 6LoWPAN receiver will receive the frame first. If the frame is
		a 6LoWPAN frame, it will claim the frame and the MAC will not pass the
		frame to any additional receivers. If it does not claim the frame, the
		MAC layer will call the next highest priority receiver, in this case,
		the MAC character driver (which should always be lowest priority since
		it is a "catch-all" type receiver).
